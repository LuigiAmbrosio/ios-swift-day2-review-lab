//2. Define a function called niceRide that takes in one String parameter called carType.

//Bonus:
//Define a function called niceRide that takes in one String parameter called carType and one [String] parameter called passengers.
//It should return a string complimenting the type of car that is passed into the function

//niceRide( passengers: []) //returns "Hey, nice car! Can I get a ride to work? You should try to carpool to save gas!"
//niceRide("truck", passengers: ["Rick, "Tom"]) //returns "Hey, nice truck! Can I use it to move to my new apartment? It's great that you are carpooling with 2 other people."
//niceRide("bike", ["Sarah"]) //returns "Hey, nice bike! Can I take it for a spin this weekend? You should not be taking anyone for a ride on that thing."
